This repo drives the creation of the [FOSS for Spectroscopy](https://bryanhanson.github.io/FOSS4Spectroscopy/) page.

If you have information to add to the table, and are not familiar with `R`, you may e-mail the relevant information to [me](mailto:hanson@depauw.edu).

If you wish to contribute to improving the appearance or performance of the table, you know the drill.  The file `FOSS4Spectroscopy.Rmd` documents how to add new information to the table.
