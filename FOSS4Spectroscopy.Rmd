The following table collects information about free and open source software ([FOSS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_and_open-source_software)) for spectroscopy.  Unless otherwise noted, the software mentioned here can be used with one or more of the following instruments: NMR, IR, Raman, ESR/EPR, fluorescence and UV-Vis.  Mass *spectrometry* software is not included here.  All information is taken from the respective websites and/or repositories.  Some softwares have been described in publications.  If so, a link is provided but keep in mind the document may be behind a paywall.

Software mentioned here appears to be regularly maintained, as evidenced by one of the following (NB: not active, will be automated in a future version):

* a commit to a repository within the past year,
* a web site updated within the past year, or
* successful continuous integration.

Additions or corrections?  Please contact [hanson@depauw.edu](mailto:hanson@depauw.edu) or submit a pull request at the [repo](https://github.com/bryanhanson/FOSS4Spectroscopy).

[![Project Status: WIP â€“ Initial development is in progress, but there has not yet been a stable, usable release suitable for the public.](https://www.repostatus.org/badges/latest/wip.svg)](https://www.repostatus.org/#wip)
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/bryanhanson/FOSS4Spectroscopy.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/bryanhanson/FOSS4Spectroscopy)

Abbreviations & Terms:

* __EDA:__ Exploratory data analysis (unsupervised chemometrics)
* __language:__ Most software is built on several languages. In the table, "language" refers to the language one uses to interact with the software. Some software has partial or complete interactive features.
* __nD NMR:__ n-dimensional NMR, 1D, 2D, 3D etc
* __Python:__ Multipurpose programming language [details](https://www.python.org/about/)
* __R:__ A software environment for statistical computing and graphics [details, platforms](https://www.r-project.org/)

# This section contains the information about the software

# Contribution Rules: One item per line, never change the order!
# Add new entries to the end of each vector (table is sortable)
# Add a comment + line number every 5 entries
# You must add an entry to each vector, if the information is not available please add an empty string: ""
# Please inspect the table and use consistent language for the vectors lang, descrip, os, notes.  This keeps the sort working well.
