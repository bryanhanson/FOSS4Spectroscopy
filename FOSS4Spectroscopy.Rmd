The following table collects information about free and open source software ([FOSS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_and_open-source_software)) for spectroscopy.  Unless otherwise noted, the software mentioned here can be used with one or more of the following instruments: NMR, IR, Raman, ESR/EPR, fluorescence and UV-Vis.  Mass *spectrometry* software is not included here.  All information is taken from the respective websites and/or repositories.  Some softwares have been described in publications.  If so, a link is provided but keep in mind the document may be behind a paywall.

Software mentioned here appears to be regularly maintained, as evidenced by one of the following:

* a commit to a repository within the past year,
* a web site updated within the past year, or
* successful continuous integration.

Additions or corrections?  Please contact [hanson@depauw.edu](mailto:hanson@depauw.edu) or submit a pull request at the [repo](https://github.com/bryanhanson/FOSS4Spectroscopy).
